The python file contains codes of different sets of stochastic models inspired from Radek Erban's book "Stochastic modelling of Reaction Diffusion processes".
The simulations are based on 3 types of models namely:
1. Fixed time simulation: Where at every time step, a random sampling determines the outcome of the reaction; The reaction being ( A→θ) 
2. Fixed reaction simulation: In this approach, a random sampling determines the outcome as well as the time point when the next reaction takes place;
 The reaction being (A→θ)
3. Repeating the simulation regime of the second point to a more complex reaction; A→θ and θ→A
I have also tried to compare stochastic and deterministic results to contrast the similarities and differences
