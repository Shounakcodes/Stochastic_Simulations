# Stochastic_Simulations
I have here tried to replicate the stochastic Doob Gillespie simulation of the resource limited actin polymerisation of a single / two actin species under different initial conditions and reaction rates
The paper concerned is uploaded as a pdf file for reference; It is a research article from the lab of Dr Jane Kondev
